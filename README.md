# Nightly Report Generator (NRG)
Generates an automatic report detailing what parts of the sky were looked at.

---
A slack API to update astronomers on survey area covered the previous night.

Currently NRG exists as a humble informant. A more complex version is in development that will act as the interface between scheduling and observations. In other words, NRG will (eventually) be able to tell a scheduler what observations should be taken and when. In addition, will resubmit observations that were either too low quality or need revisiting for any reason.

For now, NRG just tells us what is observable, what was observed, and reccomends what fields we should revisit.
